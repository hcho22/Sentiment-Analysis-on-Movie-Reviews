Mr. Hines succeeds in doing so. I, and those who watched his film with me, appreciated the fact that it was not the standard, predictable Hollywood fare that comes out every year, e.g. the Spielberg version with Tom Cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book. Obviously, everyone looks for different things in a movie. Those who envision themselves as amateur \\\\\"critics\\\\\" look only to criticize everything they can. Others rate a movie on more important bases,like being entertained, which is why most people never agree with the \\\\\"critics\\\\\". We enjoyed the effort Mr. Hines put into being faithful to H.G. Wells\\' classic novel, and we found it to be very entertaining. This made it easy to overlook what the \\\\\"critics\\\\\" perceive to be its shortcomings.\"'"

Let's see, word to the wise, lava burns you; steam burns you. You can't stand next to lava. Diverting a minor lava flow is difficult, let alone a significant one. Scares me to think that some might actually believe what they saw in this movie.<br /><br />Even worse is the significant amount of talent that went into making this film. I mean the acting is actually very good. The effects are above average. Hard to believe somebody read the scripts for this and allowed all this talent to be wasted. I guess my suggestion would be that if this movie is about to start on TV ... look away! It is like a train wreck: it is so awful that once you know what is coming, you just have to watch. Look away and spend your time on more meaningful content.\""

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj visually impressive but of course this is all about xxmaj michael xxmaj jackson so unless you remotely like xxup mj in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring . xxmaj some may call xxup mj an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie xxup but xxup mj and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the xxmaj smooth xxmaj criminal sequence and xxmaj joe xxmaj pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord . xxmaj why he wants xxup mj dead so bad is beyond me . xxmaj because xxup mj overheard his plans ? xxmaj nah , xxmaj joe xxmaj pesci 's character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno , maybe he just hates xxup mj 's music . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj lots of cool things in this like xxup mj turning into a car and a robot and the whole xxmaj speed xxmaj demon sequence . xxmaj also , the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy xxmaj bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj bottom line , this movie is for people who like xxup mj on one level or another ( which i think is most people ) . xxmaj if not , then stay away . xxmaj it does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically xxup mj 's xxunk buddy in this movie is a girl ! xxmaj michael xxmaj jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty ? xxmaj well , with all the attention i 've gave this subject xxrep 4 . hmmm well i do n't know because people can be different behind closed doors , i know this for a fact . xxmaj he is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars . i hope he is not the latter .,xxbos xxmaj the film starts with a manager ( xxmaj nicholas xxmaj bell ) giving welcome investors ( xxmaj robert xxmaj carradine ) to xxmaj primal xxmaj park . a secret project xxunk a primal animal using xxunk xxup dna , like xxunk xxmaj xxunk , and some scientists resurrect one of nature 's most fearsome predators , the xxmaj sabretooth tiger or xxmaj smilodon . xxmaj scientific ambition turns deadly , however , and when the high voltage fence is opened the creature escape and begins savagely stalking its prey - the human visitors , tourists and scientific . xxmaj meanwhile some youngsters enter in the restricted area of the security center and are attacked by a pack of large pre - historical animals which are xxunk and bigger . xxmaj in addition , a security agent ( xxmaj stacy xxmaj xxunk ) and her mate ( xxmaj brian xxmaj xxunk ) fight hardly against the carnivorous xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj the xxmaj sabretooths , themselves , of course , are the real star stars and they are astounding terrifyingly though not convincing . xxmaj the giant animals savagely are stalking its prey and the group run afoul and fight against one nature 's most fearsome predators . xxmaj furthermore a third xxmaj sabretooth more dangerous and slow stalks its victims . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the movie delivers the goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading , hair - raising chills , full of scares when the xxmaj sabretooths appear with mediocre special effects . xxmaj the story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring .the giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy xxunk performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming food . xxmaj actors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts , running , bound and leaps or dangling over walls . xxmaj and it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene . xxmaj no for small kids by realistic , gory and violent attack scenes . xxmaj other films about xxmaj sabretooths or xxmaj smilodon are the following : xxunk xxmaj james r xxmaj hickox with xxmaj vanessa xxmaj angel , xxmaj david xxmaj keith and xxmaj john xxmaj rhys xxmaj davies and the much better xxunk xxup xxunk by xxmaj roland xxmaj emmerich with with xxmaj steven xxmaj strait , xxmaj cliff xxmaj curtis and xxmaj camilla xxmaj belle . xxmaj this motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by xxmaj george xxmaj miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films . xxmaj miller is an xxmaj australian director usually working for television ( xxmaj tidal wave , xxmaj journey to the center of the earth , and many others ) and occasionally for cinema ( xxmaj the man from xxmaj snowy river , xxmaj zeus and xxmaj roxanne , xxmaj robinson xxmaj crusoe ) . xxmaj rating : xxmaj below average , bottom of barrel .,xxbos xxmaj it must be assumed that those who praised this film ( \\ the greatest filmed opera ever , \" did n't i read somewhere ? ) either do n't care for opera , do n't care for xxmaj wagner , or do n't care about anything except their desire to appear xxmaj cultured . xxmaj either as a representation of xxmaj wagner 's swan - song , or as a movie , this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster , with a leaden reading of the score matched to a xxunk , lugubrious realisation of the text . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj it 's questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera ( or , for that matter , a play , especially one by xxmaj shakespeare ) is \" about \" should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio ; xxmaj syberberg , very xxunk , but without the smallest justification from xxmaj wagner 's text , decided that xxmaj parsifal is \" about \" bisexual integration , so that the title character , in the latter stages , xxunk into a kind of beatnik babe , though one who continues to sing high tenor -- few if any of the actors in the film are the singers , and we get a double dose of xxmaj armin xxmaj jordan , the conductor , who is seen as the face ( but not heard as the voice ) of xxmaj amfortas , and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of xxmaj xxunk or xxmaj conductor xxmaj who xxmaj ate xxmaj xxunk during the playing of the xxmaj good xxmaj friday music -- in which , by the way , the xxunk xxunk of nature is represented by a xxunk of shopworn and flaccid xxunk stuck in ill - laid turf , an expedient which baffles me . xxmaj in the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts , but i ca n't think why xxmaj syberberg could n't splice in , for xxmaj parsifal and xxmaj gurnemanz , mountain pasture as lush as was provided for xxmaj julie xxmaj andrews in xxmaj sound of xxmaj music ... \n",

       "  xxmaj the sound is hard to endure , the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and xxunk unfolding of the ritual . xxmaj someone in another review mentioned the 1951 xxmaj bayreuth recording , and xxmaj xxunk , though his xxunk are often very slow , had what xxmaj jordan altogether lacks , a sense of pulse , a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music -- and , after half a century , the orchestral sound in that set , in modern xxunk , is still superior to this film . \",xxbos xxmaj superbly trashy and xxunk unpretentious 80 's exploitation , hooray ! xxmaj the pre - credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we 're dealing with a serious and harrowing drama , but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we 're up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles , rough fist - fights , lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity ! xxmaj bo and xxmaj ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship . xxmaj can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sister 's naked body and then stare at her xxunk genitals for several whole minutes ? xxmaj well , xxmaj bo does that to his sister and , judging by her dubbed laughter , she does n't mind at all . xxmaj sick , dude ! xxmaj anyway , as kids they fled from xxmaj russia with their parents , but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy . a friendly smuggler took custody over them , however , and even raised and trained xxmaj bo and xxmaj ingrid into expert smugglers . xxmaj when the actual plot lifts off , 20 years later , they 're facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable xxmaj white xxmaj fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine . xxmaj very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of \\ xxmaj white xxmaj fire \" , but it sure is a lot of fun to watch . xxmaj most of the time you have no clue who 's beating up who or for what cause ( and i bet the actors understood even less ) but whatever ! xxmaj the violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded . xxmaj the script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly  and i wo n't reveal for what reason  xxmaj bo needs a replacement for xxmaj ingrid and xxmaj fred xxmaj williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes . xxmaj bo 's principal opponent is an xxmaj italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent , the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film , there 's the obligatory \" we're - falling - in - love \" montage and loads of other attractions ! xxmaj my xxmaj god , what a brilliant experience . xxmaj the original xxmaj french title translates itself as \" xxmaj life to xxmaj survive \" , which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie : xxmaj none ! \",xxbos i do nt know why people think this is such a bad movie . xxmaj its got a pretty good plot , some good action , and the change of location for xxmaj harry does not hurt either . xxmaj sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movie like that . xxmaj eastwood is in good form as xxmaj dirty xxmaj harry , and i liked xxmaj pat xxmaj hingle in this movie as the small town cop . xxmaj if you liked xxup dirty xxup harry , then you should see this one , its a lot better than xxup the xxup dead xxup pool . 4 / 5\n",

       "  xxmaj the movie delivers the goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading , hair - raising chills , full of scares when the xxmaj sabretooths appear with mediocre special effects . xxmaj the story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring .the giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy xxunk performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming food . xxmaj actors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts , running , bound and leaps or dangling over walls . xxmaj and it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene . xxmaj no for small kids by realistic , gory and violent attack scenes . xxmaj other films about xxmaj sabretooths or xxmaj smilodon are the following : xxunk xxmaj james r xxmaj hickox with xxmaj vanessa xxmaj angel , xxmaj david xxmaj keith and xxmaj john xxmaj rhys xxmaj davies and the much better xxunk xxup xxunk by xxmaj roland xxmaj emmerich with with xxmaj steven xxmaj strait , xxmaj cliff xxmaj curtis and xxmaj camilla xxmaj belle . xxmaj this motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by xxmaj george xxmaj miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films . xxmaj miller is an xxmaj australian director usually working for television ( xxmaj tidal wave , xxmaj journey to the center of the earth , and many others ) and occasionally for cinema ( xxmaj the man from xxmaj snowy river , xxmaj zeus and xxmaj roxanne , xxmaj robinson xxmaj crusoe ) . xxmaj rating : xxmaj below average , bottom of barrel .,xxbos xxmaj it must be assumed that those who praised this film ( \\ the greatest filmed opera ever , \" did n't i read somewhere ? ) either do n't care for opera , do n't care for xxmaj wagner , or do n't care about anything except their desire to appear xxmaj cultured . xxmaj either as a representation of xxmaj wagner 's swan - song , or as a movie , this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster , with a leaden reading of the score matched to a xxunk , lugubrious realisation of the text . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj it 's questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera ( or , for that matter , a play , especially one by xxmaj shakespeare ) is \" about \" should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio ; xxmaj syberberg , very xxunk , but without the smallest justification from xxmaj wagner 's text , decided that xxmaj parsifal is \" about \" bisexual integration , so that the title character , in the latter stages , xxunk into a kind of beatnik babe , though one who continues to sing high tenor -- few if any of the actors in the film are the singers , and we get a double dose of xxmaj armin xxmaj jordan , the conductor , who is seen as the face ( but not heard as the voice ) of xxmaj amfortas , and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of xxmaj xxunk or xxmaj conductor xxmaj who xxmaj ate xxmaj xxunk during the playing of the xxmaj good xxmaj friday music -- in which , by the way , the xxunk xxunk of nature is represented by a xxunk of shopworn and flaccid xxunk stuck in ill - laid turf , an expedient which baffles me . xxmaj in the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts , but i ca n't think why xxmaj syberberg could n't splice in , for xxmaj parsifal and xxmaj gurnemanz , mountain pasture as lush as was provided for xxmaj julie xxmaj andrews in xxmaj sound of xxmaj music ... \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the sound is hard to endure , the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and xxunk unfolding of the ritual . xxmaj someone in another review mentioned the 1951 xxmaj bayreuth recording , and xxmaj xxunk , though his xxunk are often very slow , had what xxmaj jordan altogether lacks , a sense of pulse , a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music -- and , after half a century , the orchestral sound in that set , in modern xxunk , is still superior to this film . \",xxbos xxmaj superbly trashy and xxunk unpretentious 80 's exploitation , hooray ! xxmaj the pre - credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we 're dealing with a serious and harrowing drama , but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we 're up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles , rough fist - fights , lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity ! xxmaj bo and xxmaj ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship . xxmaj can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sister 's naked body and then stare at her xxunk genitals for several whole minutes ? xxmaj well , xxmaj bo does that to his sister and , judging by her dubbed laughter , she does n't mind at all . xxmaj sick , dude ! xxmaj anyway , as kids they fled from xxmaj russia with their parents , but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy . a friendly smuggler took custody over them , however , and even raised and trained xxmaj bo and xxmaj ingrid into expert smugglers . xxmaj when the actual plot lifts off , 20 years later , they 're facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable xxmaj white xxmaj fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine . xxmaj very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of \\ xxmaj white xxmaj fire \" , but it sure is a lot of fun to watch . xxmaj most of the time you have no clue who 's beating up who or for what cause ( and i bet the actors understood even less ) but whatever ! xxmaj the violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded . xxmaj the script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly  and i wo n't reveal for what reason  xxmaj bo needs a replacement for xxmaj ingrid and xxmaj fred xxmaj williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes . xxmaj bo 's principal opponent is an xxmaj italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent , the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film , there 's the obligatory \" we're - falling - in - love \" montage and loads of other attractions ! xxmaj my xxmaj god , what a brilliant experience . xxmaj the original xxmaj french title translates itself as \" xxmaj life to xxmaj survive \" , which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie : xxmaj none ! \",xxbos i do nt know why people think this is such a bad movie . xxmaj its got a pretty good plot , some good action , and the change of location for xxmaj harry does not hurt either . xxmaj sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movie like that . xxmaj eastwood is in good form as xxmaj dirty xxmaj harry , and i liked xxmaj pat xxmaj hingle in this movie as the small town cop . xxmaj if you liked xxup dirty xxup harry , then you should see this one , its a lot better than xxup the xxup dead xxup pool . 4 / 5\n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj as a final note , for historical correctness : in the real world , the xxmaj werewolf were nowhere as important as the film implies , they were mostly a final xxmaj nazi propaganda coup . xxmaj after an xxup ss unit assassinated the major of xxmaj allied - occupied xxmaj xxunk , two months before the xxunk , the xxmaj nazis announced the creation of whole legions of xxunk and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines , the xxmaj werewolf . xxmaj but only a few hundred of mostly xxmaj hitler xxmaj youth received some training , and while two or three times some were deployed to murder suspected communists or forced - labourer foreigners in xxmaj bavarian villages to imprint lasting fear on inhabitants , with xxmaj hitler 's death and the war 's end it all fell apart . \n",
